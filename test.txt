The Star to Stardom Empowerment Initiative (S2S) has in the last six months of its 
inauguration been able to achieve the following, in no particular order:

1. The sponsorship of 20 indigent students for entrance examinations into tertiary 
institutions as well as providing free tutorials/accommodation for them at an affiliate 
institution, OGD EduConsult Company Limited, Ile-Ife.

2. The Ife Youth Empowerment and Skills Acquisition Project(2023) which saw the training of about 100 young people, 70 of which completed the training successfully. This project ran for 4 weeks (3rd - 25th March, 2023), but only on weekends with extensive training on various skills such as cosmetology, catering, fashion design, graphic design, computer programming, printing and press and photography. The training was facilitated by many volunteer trainers as well as our amiable partners.

At the moment, S2S is run by singular funding of the executive director and volunteer services of our indefatigable volunteers who have contributed immensely to the organisation.

PROPOSED PROJECT
The Star to Stardom Empowerment Initiative (S2S) envisions the successful training of about 2000 young people in various vocational skills as well as providing Scholarship for at least 1500 indigent students in the primary and post primary schools before the year 2025. In no distant time, S2S plans to conduct another Ife Youth Empowerment and Skills Acquisition Project as well as health intervention outreach in the interiors of Ile-Ife and environs. It envisions the training and certification of nothing less than 500 young people.
